# GUVI - DAY 34

## Design DB model for zen class

1. First we create a database for our model.

```
create database zenclass;

```

2.  Understanding our zen portal, we define the entities in our model. Some of the entities in our model are:

    > - Students
    > - Employees
    > - Tasks
    > - Courses
    > - Queries
    > - Companies

3.  After defining the entities, we draw relationships among the entities. There are three types of relationships in MySQL:

    > - One to One
    > - One to Many or Many to One
    > - Many to Many

> - A detailed document about the Entities chosen and their relationships are provided in the documentation attached. [Doc]()

4.  Now, using the MySQL CREATE query, we define the schema of our database. [Source File](./Schema.sql)

5.  Now that we have got our schema, we populate our database using data from the data file. [Source File](./Data.sql.pdf)

6.  Now that the model is designed, to verify our database model we solve some of the real-time scenarios from our zen portal.
